# VOIDWARPER

Windows DLL injection tool which includes 5 (maybe more) different techniques for executing a malicious loaded DLL payload

# Current supported DLL injection methods

- LoadLibrary + CreateRemoteThread (Classic DLL injection)

# In progress methods

- Reflective DLL injection
- Process hollowing  (code caving)
- Thread execution hijacking
- Hook Injection via SetWindowsHookExA

Perhaps also the AtomBombing tactic if everything goes well
